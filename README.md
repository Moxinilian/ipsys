# ipsi - Ipsi Particle System of Ipsi

## Current status

This is a cool "old" project that I intend to take very far.

## TODO

- Add the classic *execute if ok* mode to the build system.
- Read all the code to understand what it was all about as it is quite old.
- Clean all the code and reorganize it in a nice way.
  - The `main.c` file should we way smaller that it currently is.
- Design a text-based modular data representation format, then add save/load.
- Add a modular interface.
- Make the build system usable with clang and on Windows.
- Allow modding ?
